=================================================
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/laurobeleche/Ensurance.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/laurobeleche/Ensurance)

Goldegg (GEC) is a sustainable cryptocurrency modeled after Satoshi Nakamotoâ€™s vision for Bitcoin. It is a decentralized, peer-to-peer transactional currency designed to offer a solution to the problem posed by the exponential increase in energy consumed by Bitcoin and other proof-of-work currencies. Proof-of-work mining is environmentally unsustainable due to the electricity used by high-powered mining hardware. Goldegg utilizes an energy efficient proof-of-stake algorithm, can be mined on any computer, and will never require specialized mining equipment.

- Fast transactions featuring guaranteed zero confirmation transactions, we call it _SwiftTX_.
- Decentralized blockchain voting providing for consensus based advancement of the current Masternode
  technology used to gecure the network and provide the above features, each Masternode is gecured
  with a collateral of 1,000 GEC.
